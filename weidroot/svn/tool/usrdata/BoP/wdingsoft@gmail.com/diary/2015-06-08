one of the amazing thing to believe in Jesus in my daily life is to be able to speak freely  in truth.. <hr><br> do not gossip.&nbsp; I had painful express.  do not text  often people's Testament. That is not the truth. The truth is what you ever experienced or felt in person.<hr><br> who speaks the truth is a happy  is freedom <hr><br> all of my Testament are the truth.  is not to glorify myself. My famifly,my church, but to glorify Him who make me the truth.
