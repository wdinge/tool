﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿relationship btw jesus and his neighbors&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>was not as kind as friends brothers sisters of what we thought:&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>You are good, i am good. Every body is good. We are family - Nobody care you say.<div><br></div><div>His human social relatinship is very stressful. He was in deep depressed. He was painful, Heart broken.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>His most hurting people to jesus are not his rulers who felt his authority or fames were threatened, &nbsp;nor the co-town people who grew up with him, knew him very well and judge him vemoniously, nor military soldiers or gauds who beat his face, brew on his head, wipen his body, nailed him, robbery of his clothes, nor his betrator of his close friends, nor the noble rightious bussinessmen who look down upon him, nor the craft who tested him to steal wisdom from him, nor those who did not like and him, mob him, curse him or hate him.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The people who hurt jesus most are among those who believe in god, had rich knowledge of bible, the professional lawyers, the hi title expert writers, well trained coworkers.</div><div><div><br></div><div>Any people who want to follow jesus will eventually have the same result as same kind of social relationship as his.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Most of us want to follow jesus, but also want to avoid the terrible human relationship, want to win everybodys love. They have to comprimise alot.</div><div><br></div><div>As matter of fact, we do not need compromise I told. Many of his neighbors love Jesus, or love him before he came. Among those were patients, bad women, lows, poors, regreters, weepers, etc. We can not count the numbers.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In any places, or community, at any time, as long as its number is equl or greater than two, they can be divided into among three groups, either left, middle or right, front, center or back, favor, neutral or against, good, mixed or bad, advanced, conservative or obsoleted,,,</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Jesus did not judge people among those groups, or well organize or coordinate his &nbsp;lovers or supporters, loyalties, or make use of the middle group, to fight against those who hurt him or those being hurt or oppressed. Jesus did not break out any wars like any history figures did or will do, nor did he escape reality to a montain to live silently with comfort.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Jesus followers advice him to escape, or lead them to resist or rebel. Even today, many chritans still advice himself or other to do so. But but all were refused. He choose to be a loser, captives, allow them to kill him.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>We can not mimic jesus to be nailed on the cross today. Even someone is willing to do so, they are not jesus followers. They are not nailed by hurting enemy, they perform only.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Real followers of jesus eventually have to face the terrible social relationship issues. If he retreat, he failed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We must pursue unity. But the man-made unit is not the unit. The uniform could not unify human heart. Nor did threatening, opression, lying, law, greedy, ideaology, thoughts, benefits, age, conditions,&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>people may sleep on the same bed, but deam differently.</div><div><br></div><div>Our unity we pursued is the unity of jesus, not only in his body, but also in trust, hope and his unique type of his love.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>He is inside of me, i am inside of him.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Even though personality is different, gender, age, color, race, behavior, languages, thread status, theory, class, party, times, locations, citizenship and so on, are all different, as long as each of people is inside of him and he is inside of each, it is the unit. The real unity, nothing in world can divide it.</div><div><br></div><div>Relationship btw jesus and his neighbors are complicated, sometimes painful, not always sweet.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></div><hr>To pursue the truth need whole life consistent endurance. To earn money on stock, you must treat it a career.&nbsp;<hr>Although i was not among you, i pray with you, hope god help us to let the difficulties passover us.<hr>China is not full of ipad yet, but the ihope, or the opposite philosophy, nohope - the buddaism.&nbsp;
