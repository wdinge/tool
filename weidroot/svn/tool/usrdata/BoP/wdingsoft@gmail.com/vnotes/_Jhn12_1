That is the signal for a new Jewish month. The moon grows until it is full, the middle of the month, and then it begins to wane until it cannot be seen. It remains invisible for approximately two days 2—and then the thin crescent reappears, and the cycle begins again.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Jews and Chinese both are&nbsp;</div><ol><li>Timing: lunar cycle calendar; first month as most important festivals.<br></li><li>Location: on the same continent -- Asia. &nbsp;</li><li>Religion: originally worship heavenly god; falling apart from God;</li><li>History: existing oldest consistent races and civilization; occupied by invaders.&nbsp;</li><li>Culture: industrial, calculate accurately, family/children education,&nbsp;</li><li>Outside View: most craft, most hated.&nbsp;</li><li>Pain: experienced massacre carnage.<br></li></ol>The differences are:<ol><li>Timing: first month(Feb-March), 60 recycles; continuous counting(start@October 6, 3761 BCE).&nbsp;</li><li>Location: west and east.</li><li>Religion: Jews, Ru/Dao/Shi/Materialism.&nbsp;</li><li>History: continuous history, huge document; &nbsp;interrupted history: one bible.</li><li>Culture: white and yellow in races.</li><li>population: most and least.&nbsp;</li></ol><div><br></div><div>The similarity are more significant than differences.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>伯大尼，<div>希伯來語 伯 意謂之地，而大尼 為痛苦。<br><div>位于橄榄山东麓，（可十一11，路二一37，）是约但河西一个小小的村庄，离耶路撒冷约六里之遥，在耶路撒冷通往耶利哥城的路上，四围是绿色的丘陵台地，和生趣盎然的橄榄树。前往耶路撒冷的客旅，常在此歇宿。马大、马利亚、和她们的弟弟拉撒路家居于此，患麻疯的西门也客居此地。<br><div>THE BETHANY of the New Testament is now called Aziriyeh, the name being derived from Lazarus. It is located on the eastern slope of Mount Olivet, about two miles south-east of Jerusalem, on the road to Jericho. It contains about twenty families, all of whom are wretchedly poor. It was no doubt a pleasanter place when Jerusalem was in its prosperity. It was a favorite resort of the Saviour, as it was the home of his friends, Lazarus (whom he raised from the dead) and Martha and Mary. It was the scene of Our Lord's great miracle, the raising of Lazarus ; and it was from a spot near the village that the Saviour ascended into Heaven.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><a class="versTxt" id="_Jhn12_1_c" style="font-size: 30px; background-color: rgb(0, 51, 0);"></a><div class="contrast" style="background-color: rgb(34, 52, 86);"><a class="versTxt" id="_Jhn12_1_c" style="font-size: 30px; background-color: rgb(0, 51, 0);"></a><a class="singleword">Jesus&nbsp;</a><a class="singleword">had&nbsp;</a><a class="singleword">raised&nbsp;</a><a class="singleword" style="background-color: rgb(90, 90, 1);">Lazarus&nbsp;</a><a class="singleword">from&nbsp;</a><a class="singleword">the&nbsp;</a><a class="singleword">dead.&nbsp;</a></div></div><div class="contrast" style="background-color: rgb(34, 52, 86);"><a class="singleword">Many people can save people from sick or dead.&nbsp;</a></div><div class="contrast" style="background-color: rgb(34, 52, 86);"><a class="singleword">None of people can not save himself from sick or dead.</a></div><div class="contrast" style="background-color: rgb(34, 52, 86);"><a class="singleword"><br></a></div><div><br></div></div></div></div>
